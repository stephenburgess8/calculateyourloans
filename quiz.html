					<h3>Simple Compound Interest</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Interest rates</em> or <em>annual percentage rates</em> (<b>r</b>) are presented as if they only collect interest once a year, but typically it's actually every month. The annual rate is divided by a number called the <em>period</em>, usually twelve (for months) or four (for quarters). The resulting interest rate is used to calculate how much interest to add to the <em>principal</em> balance in each month (or period).</p>
						<p> The <em>annual percentage yield</em> will be higher than the <em>annual percentage rate</em>. In other words, an APR of 3.4% that compounds monthly will actually collect more than 3.4% interest over the course of a year. That means that the interest rate the loan company tells you you have on a loan (6.8%) actually collects more than 6.8% total interest over the course of a year.

					<h3>Quiz: Compound Interest</h3>
					
					<p>You are taking out a car loan for $12,000 with an <i>annual percentage rate</i> of 3.4%. You took advantage of a special at the dealership— "Compounds Annually". At the end of the year, will your <i>principal</i> balance be higher or lower if you get the 'Compounds Annually" special than if you get a loan that compounds monthly?</p>

					  <p>The exponent in the compound formula to the right (represented by <em>nt</em>) tells us how many times we should multiply the number in brackets by itself. <b>r</b> is the rate (3.4% or .034) and <b>n</b> is the compound period, or 12 in the case of monthly compounding interest. We want to multiply 1 plus this number (the total number in the brackets) by itself <b>nt</b> times. The way we find <b>nt</b> is to multiply the total time number of years by how many times a year our interest is compounding. If we have a loan that compounds monthly and we are going to pay it off in five years, what is the value of our exponent, <b>nt</b>?

					<h3>Simple Compound Interest</h3>
					<p>
						When an advertisment for a car loan, a savings account, or a credit card features an <i>interest rate</i> or <i>annual percentage rate</i> <b>r</b>, often looks can be deceiving. In most cases, the <i>principal</i> balance <b>P</b> collects interest several times in a year, not just once. The annual rate is divided by a number, usually four or twelve, and then the resulting interest rate is used to calculate how much is added to the principal balance. This usually happens either quarterly or monthly. Usually this means that the <i>annual percentage yield</i> will be higher than the <i>annual percentage rate</i>. In the case of savings accounts, this means more money in your account at the end of the year. Unfortunately in the case of student loans, it means that interest collects at slightly faster than the stated interest rate.

					<h3>Loan Repayment Formula</h3>
					<p>
						Our previous example could tell us what we would need to pay back after a year of interest. However this only works when no payments are made throughout the year. What about when payments are made every month on a monthly compounding loan balance? The monthly payment for the life of the loan is what the loan repayment formula is designed to find.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's say you start with a balance of $12,000, with a rate of 3.4% or .034. Since interest compounds monthly, plug in 12 for <b>n</b>, and <b>t</b> is 5 for the life span of the loan in years. With those numbers, your numerator is 34 and your denominator is ~0.15613. 34/0.15613 gives you a monthly loan payment of $217.76. In the end, you will pay $1,065.84 in interest for a total of $13,065.84 over five years.

					<h3>Quiz: Loan Repayment</h3>
					
					<p>Here's a tough one for you. Let's say you start with $24,000 at an interest rate of 6.8%. Just as before, interest compounds monthly. If you want to repay the loan over 8 years, how much will you pay in interest?</p>
					<p>
					 Total time is 8 years
					 </p>
					 <p>
					 The compound period is monthly
					 </p>
					 <p>
					 The principal or starting value is $24,000
					</p>
					<p>
					 Using the formula to the right, we can figure the monthly payment.
					 </p>
					 <p>Once we have the monthly payment, we can multiply that times 12 for how much we will pay in a year. Then we can multiply it again by the number of years (8) to figure out how much we will pay overall. Now if we subtract the starting value of $24,000 from this number, we can figure out how much money we will pay in interest over the whole life of the loan.</p>
					 <p> 6.8% interest is not a very low interest rate. If you don't want to calculate the number, you might be able to guess about how much interest you would pay over the course of 8 years for a $24,000 loan.

						<p>Starting with a balance of $24,000 at 6.8% compounding monthly with a life of eight years, your numerator is 136 and your denominator is ~0.419 which gives a monthly payment of $324.83. Multiply this by the number of increments, in this case 96, to get a total repayment of $31,183.68. Subtract the original principal for a total of $7,183.26 in interest over the life of the loan.</p>
