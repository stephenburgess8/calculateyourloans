				<h3>Simple Compound Interest</h3>
				<p>
					When an advertisment features an <i>interest rate</i> or <i>annual percentage rate</i> <b>r</b>, often looks can be deceiving. In most cases, the <i>principal</i> balance <b>P</b> collects interest several times in a year, not just once. The annual rate is divided by a number, usually four or twelve, and then the resulting interest rate is used to calculate how much is added to the principal balance in each period. This usually happens either quarterly or monthly. The <i>annual percentage yield</i> will be higher than the <i>annual percentage rate</i>. In the case of savings accounts, this means more money in your account at the end of the year. Unfortunately in the case of student loans, it means that interest collects at slightly faster than the stated interest rate.

				<h3>Quiz: Compound Interest</h3>
				
				<p>You just took out a car loan for $12,000 with an <i>annual percentage rate</i> of 3.4%. You took advantage of two specials at the dealershipâ€”"No Payments for 12 Months," and "Compounds Annually". At the end of the year, will your <i>principal</i> balance be higher or lower with the 'Compounds Annually" special than if you got a loan that compounded monthly?</p>

				  <p><i>The Multiplicative Property of Exponents</i> says that when you have two or more numbers in the exponent (in our case, <b>n</b> and <b>t</b>, they can be summed (multiplied together) before their base (in our case, (1 + r/n)), is raised to an exponent. <b>Review</b>: Raising a number to an exponent means multiplying the number by itself as many times as the exponent says. So <b>2^4</b> is the same as <b>2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16</b>. </p><p>If it takes five years to pay off the car loan, and it compounds monthly, what will our exponent be after <b>n</b> and <b>t</b> are summed? </p>

				<h3>Loan Repayment Formula</h3>
				<p>
					Our previous example could tell us what we would need to pay back after a year of interest. However this only works when no payments are made throughout the year. What about when payments are made every month on a monthly compounding loan balance? The monthly payment for the life of the loan is what the loan repayment formula is designed to find.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's say you start with a balance of $12,000, with a rate of 3.4% or .034. Since interest compounds monthly, plug in 12 for <b>n</b>, and <b>t</b> is 5 for the life span of the loan in years. With those numbers, your numerator is 34 and your denominator is ~0.15613. 34/0.15613 gives you a monthly loan payment of $217.76. In the end, you will pay $1,065.84 in interest for a total of $13,065.84 over five years.

					<p>For the theoretical 'average' 2012 graduate who took out $29,400 at 6.8% in loans and gets a starting salary of $44,259, it will take nine years to pay back loans with a total interest accumulated of $9,989.17. This works out to a cost of around $1,100 for each year it takes to pay back the loans.</p>

					<h4 id="q3W" style="color:red; display:none;">Not Quite.</h4>

					<p>Starting with a balance of $12,000 at 3.4% with no payments for a year, the difference between compounding once a year and compounding monthly is $36.72. Once a year, the end total is $14,183.52. 12 times a year, the end total is $14,220.24.</p>
					
					<h5>Question 4</h5>
					<h4 id="q4R" style="color:green; display:none;">Right!</h4>
					<h4 id="q4W" style="color:red; display:none;">Not Quite.</h4>
					<p>Multiplying the total number of years in the life of the loan, five, by the number of times it compounds per year, 12, means that the exponent is 60. The formula in this case is $12,000 * (1 + (0.034 / 12)) ^ (12 * 5).</p>

					<h4 id="q5R" style="color:green; display:none;">Right!</h4>
					<h4 id="q5W" style="color:red; display:none;">Not Quite.</h4>

					<p>Starting with a balance of $24,000 at 6.8% compounding monthly with a life of eight years, your numerator is 136 and your denominator is ~0.419 which gives a monthly payment of $324.83. Multiply this by the number of increments, in this case 96, to get a total repayment of $31,183.68. Subtract the original principal for a total of $7,183.26 in interest over the life of the loan.</p>
